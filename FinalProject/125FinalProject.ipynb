    "## Project Description\n",
    "Similar to previous assignments, you will use Python to create your own original analysis of an existing real-world data set. You will create a Notebook documenting your research question, your process, and conclusions. Unlike previous assignments, you produce a project that includes a linear regression and \"makes a prediction\". \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also produce a short narrated video that presents your findings. The video will be presented to the class and rated by the class and by the instructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an individual project. You may not work with anyone else on this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of the Assignment\n",
    "To demonstrate your ability to:\n",
    "* Develop a research question\n",
    "* Explore data using descriptive statistics and visualizations\n",
    "* Draw appropriate conclusions from data\n",
    "* Demonstrate the skills you have developed during the semester\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting and Using a Dataset\n",
    "* You may use data from any of the following sources:\n",
    "   * [CORGIS project](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/index.html).\n",
    "   * [Data is Plural](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0)\n",
    "   * [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)\n",
    "* Please note that analyses you conduct using data may not duplicate any published analyses or analyses presented in class. \n",
    "* You may not use the following datasets: ‘broadway’, ‘state crime’, or 'recent-grads'.\n",
    "* If you are interested in using your own dataset, you will need to get permission from the instructors.\n",
    "* To work with any dataset you select, you will need to upload it to your working folder on jupyterlab.  You can do this by navigating the jupyterhub file browser into your working directory, then dragging a file from a folder on your computer (or on your desktop) into your web browser window, dropping it in the file browser area.  We will also show you how to do this in class.\n",
    "* Since you are required to include a linear regression you will need to find datasets that contain at least two continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying a Research Question\n",
    "Now the tough part. Explore your data. Use visualizations and descriptive statistics to get a broad sense of the data. Then get creative, and think of an interesting question to pursue using the data. During this process you may generate many questions. However, you are on only going to submit one question for this assignment. The question you choose should address something that isn't immediately obvious about the data set. For example, if you gave us a count of the number of plays and the number of musicals in the broadway dataset, and a bar graph showing the same, you would not be demonstrating your ability to develop an interesting research question or to explore the data in any meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Project Notebook Requirements\n",
    "* You must use **at least one linear regression visualization**\n",
    "* Your submitted notebook must clearly demonstrate your entire process using Markdown and Code cells\n",
    "* You may not submit a data visualization that has appeared in any way in any of the class materials\n",
    "* Your descriptive statistics and visualization must be appropriate for the type of data you are working with and the type of question you are trying to answer\n",
    "* Your visualization must be appropriately titled, your axes must be labelled\n",
    "* Your visualization should clearly convey meaningful information about the dataset\n",
    "* You must provide a clear and succinct explanation of your visualization and descriptive stats and how they relate to your research question\n",
    "* For further details please see the grading rubric included with this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Project Presentation Requirements\n",
    "* Your presentation must clearly and succinctly explain your research question, data source, your analyses and your conclusions\n",
    "* Your presentation may be no more than 5 minutes in length and no less than 2 minutes in length (there is a 20% penalty for failure to meet this requirement)\n",
    "* We recommend you make your presentation using [useloom.com](https://www.useloom.com/); however, you may use other software if you like. Getting the software to work is your responsibility. Software and other technical failures should be addressed by the student in advance of the deadline. All late penalties will apply to project that are late for any reason.\n",
    "* You must provide a link to your presentation video that streams from either youtube or useloom. Remember to test your link to ensure your video works and can be viewed publically by others. \n",
    "* For further details please see the grading rubric included with this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Help!\n",
    "These sorts of open-ended assignments can be challenging. Please ask us for help. Talk to us in person after class, come to office hours, or post a question to Piazza.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission code is at the end of this notebook. Be aware that if you execute the entire notebook, the final block will likely need your verification and will wait for it rather than running additional code."
