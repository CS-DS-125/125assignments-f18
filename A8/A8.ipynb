    "## Project Description\n",
    "Similar to previous assignments, you will use Python to create your own original analysis of an existing real-world data set. You will create a Notebook documenting your research question, your process, and conclusions. Unlike previous assignments, this assignment also requires you to examine continuous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an individual project. You may not work with anyone else on this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of the Assignment\n",
    "To demonstrate your ability to:\n",
    "* Develop a research question involving correlational data\n",
    "* Explore correlational data using descriptive statistics and visualizations\n",
    "* Draw appropriate conclusions from data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting and Using a Dataset\n",
    "* You may not use the following datasets: ‘broadway’, ‘state crime’, or 'recent-grads'. \n",
    "* Choose and then download a dataset to work on using this link: [CORGIS project](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/index.html). (If you want to use a non-CORGIS dataset you must get approval from an instructor first).\n",
    "* To work with any dataset you select, you will need to upload it to your 125assignments-f18/A8 folder on jupyterlab.  You can do this by navigating the jupyterhub file browser into your A8 directory, then dragging a file from a folder on your computer (or on your desktop) into your web browser window, dropping it in the file browser area.  We will also show you how to do this in class.\n",
    "* Since you are required to include a scatter matrix by group (see below) you will need to find datasets that contain variables you can correlate as well as groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying a Research Question\n",
    "Now the tough part. Explore your data. Use visualizations and descriptive statistics to get a broad sense of the data. Then get creative, and think of an interesting question to pursue using the data. During this process you may generate many questions. However, you are on only going to submit one question for this assignment. The question you choose should address something that isn't immediately obvious about the data set. For example, if you gave us a count of the number of plays and the number of musicals in the broadway dataset, and a bar graph showing the same, you would not be demonstrating your ability to develop an interesting research question or to explore the data in any meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Requirements\n",
    "* You must use **at least one scatter matrix visualization** that looks at associations **by group** (see 7.4.4 in the textbook for an example)\n",
    "* Your submitted notebook must clearly demonstrate your entire process using Markdown and Code cells\n",
    "* You may not submit a visualization that appeared in any way in any of the class materials\n",
    "* Your descriptive statistics and visualization must be appropriate for the type of data you are working with and the type of question you are trying to answer\n",
    "* Your visualization must be appropriately titled, your axes must be labelled\n",
    "* Your visualization should clearly convey meaningful information about the dataset\n",
    "* You must provide a clear and succinct explanation of your visualization and descriptive stats and how they relate to your research question\n",
    "* Additional specifics requirements are included in the markdown comments in individaul notebook section provided below \n",
    "\n",
    "## Help!\n",
    "These sorts of open-ended assignments can be challenging. Please ask us for help. Talk to us in person after class, come to office hours, or post a question to Piazza.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission code is at the end of this notebook. Be aware that if you execute the entire notebook, the final block will likely need your verification and will wait for it rather than running additional code."
